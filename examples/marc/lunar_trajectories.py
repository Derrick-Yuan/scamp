"""
Interactive piano script for the first movement of "Lunar Trajectories".
The `notes` list below is a list of all the notes played by the middle arpeggio part in the first movement
of the Moonlight Sonata, in order. If a pitch is in that list, then when it is depressed, the piano reacts
by playing whichever pitches follow that pitch the first time it occurs in the list. If a pitch is not in
the list, then instead we look for the same pitch class but in a different octave, and follow it up by the
notes that follow that pitch (transposed back up or down by however many octaves).

Every pitch class appears in the first movement, so we don't have the issue of searching for a pitch class
that doesn't occur.
