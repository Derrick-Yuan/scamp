"""
A script written at the request of Paul Timmermans, in which different pitches or ranges of pitches
on the keyboard can be mapped to particular instruments and chords. The heart of the script is the
dictionary `pitch_to_instrument_and_pitches`, which expresses, for each key, which pitches and on
which instrument should be played.
