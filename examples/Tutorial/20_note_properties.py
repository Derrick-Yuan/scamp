"""
SCAMP Example: Note Properties

Shows how the fourth (optional) properties argument to "play_note" can be used to affect other aspects of playback and
notation, such as articulation and noteheads. All properties are ultimately converted into a NotePropertiesDictionary;
If a string is given, it is parsed into key / value pairs. In many cases, e.g. with "staccato" below, SCAMP can infer
that it is referring to an articulation.
