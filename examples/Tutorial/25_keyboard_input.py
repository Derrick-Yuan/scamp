SCAMP EXAMPLE: Computer Keyboard Input

(WARNING: consumes key events and makes the keyboard otherwise unresponsive. To avoid this, you can remove the
suppress=True flag under register_keyboard_listener)

Demonstration of receiving computer keyboard events and using them to play notes based on the key number. Any key
whose number code lies within a reasonable range triggers the playback of a note of that MIDI pitch.
