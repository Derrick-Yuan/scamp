SCAMP EXAMPLE: Mouse Input

(WARNING: consumes mouse events and makes the mouse otherwise unresponsive. To avoid this, you can remove the
suppress=True flag under register_mouse_listener)

Demonstration of receiving computer mouse events and using them to play notes based on x and y position.
Notes are started on mouse down and released on mouse up.  Left click plays a piano note, and right click plays
a flute note. X position controls pitch, Y controls volume. By moving the mouse after clicking, the pitch can be bent
up and down and the volume can be changed.
