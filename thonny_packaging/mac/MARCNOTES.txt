In copy_python_framework.sh I added the following lines after "cp -R $ORIGINAL_FRAMEWORK_PATH/* $NEW_FRAMEWORK_PATH":

for d in $NEW_FRAMEWORK_PATH/Versions/*; do
    if [ "$(basename $d)" != "$VERSION" ]; then
        rm -rf $d
    fi
done

This delete any frameworks that aren't 3.7 (or whatever the desired version is) from the bundle.

In create_dist_bundle.sh, I did a find replace on "Aivar Annamaa" replacing it with "Marc Evanstein", so that it signs with my certificate (albeit not certified by apple, since they'd charge me).
