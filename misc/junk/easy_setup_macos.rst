Easy Setup on MacOS
===================

The easiest way to get setup with SCAMP and Python on MacOS, is to download `a custom version of the Thonny Python
editor with all of the SCAMP libraries pre-installed <https://marcevanstein.ddns.net/s/6kxBSxGrtxjAyCw>`_. (Thonny is a
simple development environment designed specifically for beginners. You can read more about it
`here <https://thonny.org/>`_.)

After installing the Thonny/SCAMP bundle, the next step is to `download and install LilyPond <http://lilypond.org>`_.
Place the installed copy of LilyPond in the Applications directory so that SCAMP can find it.

..  note::

    If you are running MacOS Catalina 10.15 (or future versions), the current official release of LilyPond will not work
    for you, since it is a 32-bit application, and Catalina abandons 32-bit support. However, you can download an
    experimental 64-bit build `here <https://marcevanstein.ddns.net/s/jZpXE3ZBY5add3G>`_.

This video provides a step-by-step walk-through of the installation process:
