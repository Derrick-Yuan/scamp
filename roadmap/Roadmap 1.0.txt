Documentation:
    - Basic Tutorial, intermixing the examples in the tutorial directory with text

Quantization:
    - Make quantization parameters accessible without creating a whole quantization scheme. Some cleanup is needed in
    that whole interface.

Engraving:
    - Fix to using new abjad; change install instructions
    - Change list of bar lengths to list of beats to place bars on
    - Get Tempo curves working in abjad
    - Engraving sudden tempo changes correctly, test this thoroughly
    - Engraving Microtonal adjustments: make it chords, as well as for glissandi, and in both abjad and MusicXML.
    - Engraving of correct clef for a part as a whole. Maybe by using instrument defaults based on name and then falling
    back to the average pitch.
    - Arbitrary text annotations passed through the properties dictionary. Should there by a CombinedPropertyChange
    class that allows for a notation and playback change?
    - Dynamics (just as annotations to notes)
    - Engraving Trills, mordents and other symbol notations like that (perhaps, for now, affect playback by adding a
    square wave for a trill, similar thing with mordent).
    - Two eighth note rests in a triplet shouldn't combine
