Documentation:
    - Point to the example scripts in the documentation
    - Point to the Forum in the tutorial
    - Music made with SCAMP in the documentation!
    - Add last tutorial video to tutorial videos page
    - Make a documentation page for note properties, including tables of all the possible options.
    - Add documentation for installing nicer soundfont
    - Maybe make a multi-tempo example that doesn't have nested tempi first.

Testing:
    - Look into unittests

Playback:
    - Can we put chords on the same clock??
    - Have pitch and volume playback adjustments affect start_notes?
    - Add a soundfile playback implementation

Engraving:
    - Clean up quantization: allow setting exact divisors. Remove max indigestibility in favor of setting exact divisors.
    - Engraving lines!
    - Engraving dynamics!!!!!!
    - Fixing the wanderer class tempo stuff
    - Fix problem where it splits into two voices when you have notes that overlapped originally but then quantize
    in such a way that they would fit into the same voice. e.g. 0 to 0.7, 0.65 - 1.0, quantized into a triplet.
    - Engraving Trills, mordents and other symbol notations like that (perhaps, for now, affect playback by adding a
    square wave for a trill, similar thing with mordent).
    - Two eighth note rests in a triplet shouldn't combine
    - Key signatures?

Assorted:
    - Consider cleaning out the playback implementation shit, so that all instruments -- in or outside an ensemble --
    can share module-level playback resources as far as soundfonts are concerned.
    - Fluidsynth save to wave file!

Extensions:
    - MIDI file to Performance
