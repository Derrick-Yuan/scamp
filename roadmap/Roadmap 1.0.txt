Documentation:
    - Maybe make a multi-tempo example that doesn't have nested tempi first.

Testing:
    - Look into unittests

Playback:
    - Can we put chords on the same clock??

Engraving:
    - Engraving clefs for copies of instrument (second instrument called violin can end up with bass clef)
    - Engraving tremolo in abjad. Other notations?
    - Fix problem where it splits into two voices when you have notes that overlapped originally but then quantize
    in such a way that they would fit into the same voice. e.g. 0 to 0.7, 0.65 - 1.0, quantized into a triplet.
    - Should there by a CombinedPropertyChange
    class that allows for a notation and playback change?
    - Dynamics (just as annotations to notes)
    - Engraving Trills, mordents and other symbol notations like that (perhaps, for now, affect playback by adding a
    square wave for a trill, similar thing with mordent).
    - Two eighth note rests in a triplet shouldn't combine
    - Key signatures?

Assorted:
    - Consider cleaning out the playback implementation shit, so that all instruments -- in or outside an ensemble --
    can share module-level playback resources as far as soundfonts are concerned.
    - Fluidsynth save to wave file!
