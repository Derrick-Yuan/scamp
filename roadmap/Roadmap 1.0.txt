Documentation:
    - Basic Tutorial, intermixing the examples in the tutorial directory with text
    - Maybe make a multi-tempo example that doesn't have nested tempi first.

Testing:
    - Look into unittests
    - Create a way of testing all the examples without having to wait for them.

Playback:
    - Can we put chords on the same clock??

Engraving:
    - Engraving Microtonal adjustments in both abjad and MusicXML. Might want to make a special lilypond command for
    microtonal annotations? Don't engrave after first part of tied note unless glissando.
    - Engraving tremolo in abjad. Other notations?
    - Engraving text in abjad.
    - Fix problem where it splits into two voices when you have notes that overlapped originally but then quantize
    in such a way that they would fit into the same voice. e.g. 0 to 0.7, 0.65 - 1.0, quantized into a triplet.
    - Arbitrary text annotations passed through the properties dictionary. Should there by a CombinedPropertyChange
    class that allows for a notation and playback change?
    - Dynamics (just as annotations to notes)
    - Engraving Trills, mordents and other symbol notations like that (perhaps, for now, affect playback by adding a
    square wave for a trill, similar thing with mordent).
    - Two eighth note rests in a triplet shouldn't combine
    - Key signatures?

Assorted:
    - make to and from JSON use a custom encoder and decoder. This requires overriding object_hook in the decoder, and
    default in the encoder. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48991911/how-to-write-a-custom-json-decoder-for-a-complex-object
