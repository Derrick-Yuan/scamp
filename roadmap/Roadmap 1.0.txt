Documentation:
    - Basic Tutorial, intermixing the examples in the tutorial directory with text
    - Maybe make a multi-tempo example that doesn't have nested tempi first.

Playback:
    - Embed fluidsynth in MacOS version. Have it try to load the built-in one, then try outside
    - Can we put chords on the same clock??

Quantization:
    - Make quantization turn all timing values into Fractions, which are then used in Score and Score creation

Engraving:
    - Change list of bar lengths to list of beats to place bars on
    - Get Tempo curves working in abjad
    - Engraving sudden tempo changes correctly, test this thoroughly
    - End of accel or rit not engraving when still going at end of score; fix this!
    - Engraving Microtonal adjustments in both abjad and MusicXML. Might want to make a special lilypond command for
    microtonal annotations? Don't engrave after first part of tied note unless glissando.
    - Engraving of correct clef for a part as a whole. Maybe by using instrument defaults based on name and then falling
    back to the average pitch.
    - Engraving tremolo in abjad. Other notations?
    - Engraving text in abjad.
    - Arbitrary text annotations passed through the properties dictionary. Should there by a CombinedPropertyChange
    class that allows for a notation and playback change?
    - Dynamics (just as annotations to notes)
    - Engraving Trills, mordents and other symbol notations like that (perhaps, for now, affect playback by adding a
    square wave for a trill, similar thing with mordent).
    - Two eighth note rests in a triplet shouldn't combine

Assorted:
    - make to and from JSON use a custom encoder and decoder. This requires overriding object_hook in the decoder, and
    default in the encoder. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48991911/how-to-write-a-custom-json-decoder-for-a-complex-object
