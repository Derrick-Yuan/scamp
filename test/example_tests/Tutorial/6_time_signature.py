SCAMP Example: Time Signatures

Plays a simple C Major arpeggio, and generates notation for it in three different ways:
    - with a 3/8 time signature
    - with a 3/8 time signature for the first measure followed by 2/4
    - with alternating 3/8 and 2/4 time signatures
    - with a list of bar lengths determining time signatures
