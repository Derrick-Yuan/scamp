# a list of lists can give values, durations, and (optionally) curve shapes
# this results in segment durations of 2 and 1 and curve shapes of -2 and 0
# NB: by default, envelopes created through list shorthand like this are
# resized to the duration of the note, whereas Envelope objects passed directly
# are not. So in this case, the durations of 2 and 1 get scaled up to 8/3 and 4/3
# so that the whole envelope lasts 4 beats (the duration of the note).
# You can change this behavior so that it resizes for Envelope objects as well,
# or so that it never resizes, by altering playback_settings.resize_parameter_envelopes
