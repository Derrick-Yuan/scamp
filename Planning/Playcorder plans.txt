NEED TO EXAMINE XML AND IT'S COMPATIBILITY WITH LILIPOND

PCScore
->Staff Group
->Staff
->Measure (set appropriate clef)
->Voice (set is_simultaneous)
->Tuplet
..
->Tuplet
->Notes

each should implement to_lilypond and to_XML

Spanners (attached to multiple notes):
hairpins
slurs
beams
textspanners

Attachments (attached to single notes)
Articulations
Dynamics

Tricky: 
glissandi
ritards, accelerandi, Sudden tempo changes!


QuantizationScheme
MeasureQuantizationScheme
BeatQuantizationScheme
Accelerandi / Decelerandi (TempoEnvelope is the most general case. Depict this as a bunch of accelerandi decelerandi with metronome marks before and after.)


Performance score:
Most basically: Notes and Timings
Can attach:
	- TempoEnvelope (including ramped and sudden tempos)
	â€“ DynamicEnvelope (a
	- Quantization scheme (how stuff is divided into measures and notes)
During recording, the tempo can be ramped or set (ramp_to, slew_to)
Durations should be set in beats, but recorded in seconds based on the current tempo. The default is q=60, so it ends up as seconds.

Could have a utility to search for the most natural tempo.

Performance score to PCScore:
	Quantize to measures notes and voices
	Notate tempo envelope as fully as possible


PCScore to Performance Score:
	-Flatten nested Tuplets, realize as durations
	-realize glissandi as pitch envelopes
	-multiply out dynamics and crescendi as volume envelopes
