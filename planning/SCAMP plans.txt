- engraving text! Also, microtonal adjustments
- allow time signatures to be given as floats as well as strings, where the floats represent the number of beats
- Engraving sudden tempo changes
- maybe make clock not note down the start time until its first call to wait?
- Get recombination of larger notes working
- Maybe max pitch bend should only get expanded from the default of 2 when a pitch bend is requested that goes beyond that?
- Engraving tempo in abjad
- MIDIScampInstrument: allow preset shifts with keyword string
- Playback adjustments: allow preset change as a possibility
- Trills and Tremolo: can implement by splitting playback into many notes, changing preset, or -- in the case of trill --
by simply adding a square wave envelope to the pitch.
- Engraving Dynamics?? Probably need to be able to attach dynamic curves to instruments / voices of instruments. The way
to do this would be to simply write them as DynamicEnvelope("fp<f") or something like that, parsing the string into an
envelope for playback and then later attaching that to the staff as dynamics. This is tricky though! Basically, would
be implemented as a parallel stream to the note stream, I think...
- Engraving slurs?
- Make outgoing midi stream an addable function?
- Make expenvelope work in IPython notebook? Maybe other stuff too somehow?
