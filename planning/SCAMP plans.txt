- Fix bug where there's duplicate tempo markings, e.g. in piano phase
- Check on staccato; doesn't seem to be outputting
- Make Session a subclass of Clock. Also maybe make clock not note down the start time until its first call to wait?
- Get recombination of larger notes working
- add append function to TempoCurve
- Engraving sudden tempo changes
- Engraving tempo in abjad
- MIDIScampInstrument: allow preset shifts with keyword string
- Playback adjustments: allow preset change as a possibility
- Trills and Tremolo: can implement by splitting playback into many notes, changing preset, or -- in the case of trill --
by simply adding a square wave envelope to the pitch.
- Engraving Dynamics?? Probably need to be able to attach dynamic curves to instruments / voices of instruments. The way
to do this would be to simply write them as DynamicEnvelope("fp<f") or something like that, parsing the string into an
envelope for playback and then later attaching that to the staff as dynamics. This is tricky though! Basically, would
be implemented as a parallel stream to the note stream, I think...
- Engraving slurs?
- Make outgoing midi stream an addable function?
- Make expenvelope work in IPython notebook? Maybe other stuff too somehow?
- Linux Sampler
