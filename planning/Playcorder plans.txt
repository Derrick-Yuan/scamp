- If quantize is called on a quantized score / part, maybe throw out the quantization and requantize?
- Get basic MusicXML working
- Get recombination of larger notes working
- Engraving tempo curve; accel, rit, sudden changes
- MIDIPlayorderInstrument: allow preset shifts with keyword string
- Playback adjustments: allow preset change as a possibility
- Trills and Tremolo: can implement by splitting playback into many notes, changing preset, or -- in the case of trill --
by simply adding a square wave envelope to the pitch.
- Engraving Dynamics?? Probably need to be able to attach dynamic curves to instruments / voices of instruments. The way
to do this would be to simply write them as DynamicEnvelope("fp<f") or something like that, parsing the string into an
envelope for playback and then later attaching that to the staff as dynamics. This is tricky though! Basically, would
be implemented as a parallel stream to the note stream, I think...
- Engraving Slurs
- Engraving Beams???
